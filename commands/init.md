# Design Initialization

Interactive preplanning phase that configures your design project.

## Directory-Scoped (ESLint-Style)

pixel-perfect works in any directory. Config and artifacts cascade from parent directories.

```
project/
├── design/
│   ├── config.yaml       # Base settings
│   └── tokens.yaml
└── features/
    └── auth/
        └── design/
            ├── config.yaml   # Auth overrides (optional)
            └── flows.yaml    # Auth-specific
```

## Usage

```
/pixel-perfect:init [directory] [options]
```

## Arguments

- `[directory]`: Target directory to initialize. Defaults to current directory.

## Options

- `--force`: Overwrite existing `design/config.yaml`
- `--quick`: Auto-accept inferred values with minimal prompts
- `--platforms <list>`: Pre-set platforms (comma-separated: `mobile-ios,web-desktop`)
- `--vibe <name>`: Pre-set design vibe (`minimal`, `modern`, `playful`, etc.)

## What It Does

This command walks you through setting up your design project:

1. **Requirements Discovery** - Finds or asks for your PRD/requirements document
2. **Device Targeting** - Infers and confirms which platforms you're designing for
3. **Design Vibe** - Captures the aesthetic direction for your mockups
4. **URL Analysis** - Fetches and analyzes any reference URLs in requirements
5. **Configuration** - Saves preferences to `{directory}/design/config.yaml`

## Config File

Creates `{directory}/design/config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Auto-generated by /pixel-perfect:init
version: "2.0"
created: "2025-02-01"

# Requirements source
requirements:
  path: "PRD.md"
  analyzed: true

# Target platforms
platforms:
  - responsive-web

# Design aesthetic
vibe:
  primary: "modern"
  description: "Clean, contemporary design"

# Analyzed references
references:
  urls_analyzed: 2
  patterns:
    - "bottom navigation"
```

**Config applies to:** The target directory AND all subdirectories below it (like `.eslintrc`).

**Subdirectories can override:** Create their own `design/config.yaml` to override parent settings.

## Preplanning Workflow

### Step 1: Requirements Discovery

**If `--requirements <path>` is provided:** Use that file directly.

**Otherwise, search for requirements in this order:**
1. `{directory}/PRD.md`
2. `{directory}/requirements.md`
3. `{directory}/*.md` (any markdown file)

**If a candidate file is found**, ask the user to confirm.

### Step 2: Device Targeting

**Default: Responsive Web**

| Platform | Indicators |
|----------|------------|
| Responsive Web | DEFAULT |
| Mobile (iOS) | "iOS", "iPhone", "Swift" |
| Mobile (Android) | "Android", "Kotlin" |
| Desktop App | "electron", "desktop app" |
| CLI/Terminal | "command line", "CLI" |
| Tablet | "tablet-only", "iPad" |

### Step 3: Design Vibe

| Vibe | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Minimal | Clean, whitespace-focused |
| Modern | Contemporary patterns, current trends |
| Playful | Rounded corners, bright colors |
| Corporate | Professional, structured |
| Bold | High contrast, strong typography |
| Technical | Data-dense, developer-focused |
| Elegant | Refined, sophisticated |

### Step 4: URL Analysis

Fetches and analyzes URLs from requirements.

## Example Sessions

### Initialize current directory

```
> /pixel-perfect:init

Scanning for requirements...
Found: PRD.md

? Is this your requirements document?
  > Yes, use this file

? What platforms are you designing for?
  [x] Responsive Web

? What's the design vibe?
  > Modern

Configuration saved to design/config.yaml

Ready to plan! Run:
  /pixel-perfect:plan
```

### Initialize specific directory

```
> /pixel-perfect:init features/auth

Scanning for requirements...
Found: features/auth/PRD.md

Configuration saved to features/auth/design/config.yaml

This config will also apply to all subdirectories under features/auth/
(unless they override with their own design/config.yaml)
```

## Skipping Init

If `design/config.yaml` already exists in the target (or parent), the design workflow uses existing config.

To reconfigure:
- Delete `design/config.yaml` and run init again
- Run `/pixel-perfect:init --force`

## Integration with Design Workflow

When you run `/pixel-perfect:design`:
1. Checks for `design/config.yaml` in target (or parent)
2. If missing, automatically runs init first
3. Uses config to inform all subsequent phases
